## Hi there, I'm Swapnil 👋

I’m a backend software engineer with a deep love for programming languages. You could say I’m on a never-ending quest to find the perfect syntax—or at least the one that sparks the most joy! Whether it’s the memory safety of Rust or the simplicity of Go, I’m always eager to dive into something new and add another language to my growing collection.

Some things about me:

💻 Programming Languages: My fascination with languages goes beyond just writing code—I’m all about understanding the philosophy behind them. From Swift to C, each one offers a unique perspective on problem-solving, and yes, I have some strong opinions on which ones get it right 😆. 

🌐 Network Programming: Recently I have developed an interest in networking protocols have been delving deeper into their implementations. A from-scratch implementation of HTTP comming soon? 

⚙️ Tools: When it comes to tools, I’m not just opinionated—I’m passionate. Whether it’s the perfect editor setup, the best way to organize a project, or the ultimate CI/CD pipeline, I’ve got my preferences and I’m always refining them.

📝 Writing: I am always on the lookout for jotting down an opinionated article (with horrible success) about a topic. Let's see if I finally publish something in this life.

## Currently Working On:
### Clox - Compiler and VM for Lox
CLox is an implementation of the programming language Lox in C. Currently working on the orginal implementation of Lox from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).
Repository for the implementation: https://github.com/chauhanswapnil/clox

### Liurnia - From scratch custom Programming Language
Liurnia is a self designed C like prgoramming language designed. I am working on writing the first implementation of Liurnia in Rust. The plan is to have a bytecode compiled language with it's own VM and a shareable executable. Ongoing task is to finish writing up the parser.
